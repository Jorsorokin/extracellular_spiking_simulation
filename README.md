# extracellular_spiking_simulation

A series of MATLAB functions for simulating extracellular multi-electrode neural recordings. The simulations are modelled from real data, to capture baseline noise fluctuations, neural action potential shapes, firing rates, and external "events" that can be arbitrarily added

This code was originally written for experimentation; specifically, to test whether the ability to sort individual neurons is dependent on various parameters of the neural dynamics and background noise. However, the simulations can be adapted to any use as they can be modelled from any real data.
